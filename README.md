Docx file to Html and Json

Technology : Python, Flask


In this project, the user submits a docx file adhering to a predefined format, which includes tables and images. We subsequently process the file, converting it into both HTML for display on the website and JSON for storage in the database. The images embedded in the docx file are uploaded to an S3 bucket, and their respective links are incorporated into both the HTML and JSON representations.
